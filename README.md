# DuplicateStreams

DuplicateStreams is a module for [Wowza Streaming Engine™ media server software](https://www.wowza.com/products/streaming-engine) that allows a stream to be duplicated from one application instance to another instance on the same Wowza media server.

## Prerequisites

Wowza Streaming Engine 4.0.0 or later is required.

## Usage

This module for duplicating streams only works within the same Wowza media server. This module is recommended over using the Push Publishing feature because it will incur less overhead to perform this functionality.
